-- INSTALLATION --------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation involves the simple copying of files therefore an installer or setup program is not required.

Do not extract the archive into the folder "c:\Program Files\" or "c:\Program Files (x86)\"
since you will need administrative privileges in some Windows versions.

Since Windows keeps control of these folders other problems might occur like replaced or deleted files.

Extract the Zip archive into a folder like "c:\Own Programs\Little FGconnect".
Then start the program by double-clicking "littlefgconnect.exe".

It is recommended to delete the any old installation directories of Little FGconnect.
You can also install a newer version into another directory but do not merge the installations.

Anyway, no settings are a stored in the installation directory. Therefore it is safe to remove it.

In some cases you have to install the MS Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable package
(https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=40784). Install both 32 and 64 bit versions.
Usually this is already installed since many other programs require it.

See the online manual for more details.

The installation on Linux and macOS computers is simlar except different paths.
